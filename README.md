# [NEXUS - Distributed Social Networking System]
Nexus is a lightweight, decentralized social networking platform. It enables users on independent servers (nodes) to interact seamlessly through posts, likes, comments, and follows ‚Äî all without relying on a centralized provider like Facebook or Twitter.

Each user operates on a node, and the platform uses an inbox-based model to deliver content and interactions across the network. Public, unlisted, and friends-only posts can be created and shared, with appropriate visibility rules applied. When a user follows someone on another node, their content is aggregated into the local stream, allowing cross-node social interaction.

This system demonstrates the core mechanics of federated social media while maintaining simplicity suitable for educational and prototype purposes.
